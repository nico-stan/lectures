    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm, that is, a programming style and technique, which goes beyond the implementation itself. This paradigm is based on the \"object\" concept, which can contain both data, in the form of fields called \"attributes\", and code for its manipulation in the form of procedures and functions, called \"methods\". Thanks to this, we can group everything under a single data type (the object \"class\"), which facilitates the modularity and reusability of the code.\n",

    "Classes are often compared to cookie cutters and objects to the cookies themselves. While all cookies made from the same pan have the same shape, each one takes on individual attributes after baking. Things like color, texture, flavor... can be very different.\n",
    "In other words, the cookies share a manufacturing process and some attributes, but they are independent of each other and of the mold itself, and that makes each one unique.\n",
    "Extrapolating from the example, a class is just a script about how the objects that will be created with it should be."

    "1 - **Data abstraction**: Something we do naturally in our understanding of the world is the abstraction of concrete information in concepts or classes. For example, the concept of \"car\" evokes in us an idea of ​​a vehicle with four wheels, a steering wheel, an engine... Our car is a specific \"instance\" of that concept, and different from other cars, but we are capable of associating certain properties or characteristics to said concept above specific details. This ability to abstract a concept is essential for the development of human language and, of course, such a good idea has been transferred to the world of programming. In OOP, we call the abstract concept \"class\" and the realization of that concept \"object\". Your car is concrete, you can drive it, it is an object, an \"instance\" of the class \"car\".\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2 - **Encapsulation**: Each type of object contains its own information and can be manipulated in a particular way. A car can be driven and has a certain pressure in the wheels, a color, a certain level of gasoline, etc. With a GPS we can obtain our position coordinates and the batteries will have a certain charge. A dog barks, has a weight, an age. All those attributes and \"methods\" are \"encapsulated\" within the object, and are accessible only through a given object. The advantage is that we don't need to have, for example, a list with names, another with ages, another with weights... but rather a list of objects and each one contains, that is, encapsulates, its own information.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3 - **Inheritance**: Some classes can specialize others. For this, the specialized class \"inherits\" the properties of the more general class, called the \"superclass\". For example, the \"Car\" and \"Truck\" classes can inherit from the \"Vehicle\" class. This is a way of reusing code, by being able to assume those common properties between several classes in a superior class. Python supports \"multiple inheritance\", so a class can be defined as a subclass of several classes from which it would inherit all its properties (attributes and methods) at once.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   4 - **Polymorphism**: A square can be drawn, a circle as well, just as any other shape can be drawn. \"Square\" and \"Circle\" would be subclasses of \"Shape\". The \"Shape\" superclass implements a draw() method, and both the \"Square\" subclass and the \"Circle\" subclass override this method to their particular case. So a function could accept an object of type \"Shape\" as a parameter and call the draw() method without knowing if the passed argument is a circle or a square. Each object knows its level of specialization and the concrete implementation of its methods. This ability to use superclass methods in code but resolve to subclass methods at run time is called \"Polymorphism\": the same variable can take different forms."

    "A class is like an abstract type for objects that, in addition to storing values ​​called attributes, has associated a series of functions that we call methods. An instance of a class is the same as saying an object of that class. Instantiating a class refers to creating an object that belongs to that class.\n",
    "In Python, data types are classes, and any literal or variable of one of these types is an object that instantiates the type's class. For example: a = 2222 is equivalent to instantiating the PyLongObject class by assigning an internal attribute the value 2222. This is what happens at a low level, but we can consider that the variable a is of type int. We can know the type of any variable, that is, the class it instantiates, with the type() function, and the identifier of the instantiated object with the id() function."
